## Getting Started

The year is 2026. We build on tmux (2007), git worktrees (2015), terminals (1978, the VT100 era, when even [Francesc](https://github.com/barnolacesc) was only a future project), and GPU rendering (thanks [Mitchell](https://mitchellh.com) for [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)). Old tools, new tricks.

You need two things: a Mac and a vague sense that your current workflow could be better.

```
brew install --cask dockyard
```

Dockyard works best when these are installed (it'll tell you if they're missing):

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)** or **[Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex)** — pick the coding CLI you want in the Agent tab
- **git** — you probably have this
- **[gh](https://cli.github.com/)** — GitHub CLI, for PR status and quick actions
- **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)** — optional, enables session persistence

#### Your first 30 seconds

1. Open Dockyard
2. Drop a git repository onto the sidebar (or click **+** to pick one)
3. Hit **⌘N** to create a workstream
4. That's it. You're coding with AI now.

No config files required. Dockyard detects your git setup, installed tools, and GitHub connections automatically.

## Core Concepts

The three things you'll interact with every day.

### Projects

A project is a git repository. Drop a directory on the sidebar or click the **+** button. Dockyard checks if it's a git repo (and offers to initialize one if it's not).

The project overview shows repository info, GitHub details (stars, forks, open issues), up to 5 recent PRs, and auto-discovered markdown documentation from your repo.

Projects sort by **Recent** (last activity) by default. Toggle to **A-Z** if you're that kind of person.

Right-click a project in the sidebar for quick access: **Reveal in Finder**, **Open in External Terminal**, **Open on GitHub**, or **Remove** (files stay on disk, we're not monsters).

### Workstreams

A workstream is where the work happens. Each one gets its own git worktree, branch, terminal, coding agent, and browser tab. They're completely isolated from each other.

**⌘N** creates a new workstream. Behind the scenes:

1. Fetches the latest default branch from origin
2. Creates a git worktree with a fresh branch (prefixed with your branch prefix, default: `ff`)
3. Symlinks `.env` and `.env.local` from the main repo (if enabled)
4. Runs the setup script (if configured)
5. Launches the coding agent

The UI shows up instantly — worktree creation happens in the background.

#### Workstream tabs

- **Info** — branch name, PR status, project docs
- **Agent** (⌘Return) — your selected coding CLI session
- **Environment** — setup and run script controls
- **Terminal** (⌘T) — additional terminal tabs, as many as you want
- **Browser** (⌘B) — embedded browser with auto-port detection
- **Editor** (⌘O) — built-in Monaco code editor with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense

#### Branch auto-rename

With **Auto-rename branch** enabled in settings, the coding agent automatically renames your branch to match your current task based on your prompts. So `dy/coral-tidal-reef` becomes `dy/fix-login-timeout`.

#### Removing vs. purging

- **Remove** — kills terminals and agent, but the worktree stays on disk
- **Purge** — permanently deletes the worktree and branch (asks for confirmation if there are uncommitted changes)

When a PR is merged, Dockyard shows a "Purge" badge so you know it's safe to clean up.

### The Coding Agent

The coding agent tab runs either [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) or [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) in an embedded terminal. Choose the CLI in Settings, then use the same Agent tab in every workstream.

#### Agent settings

- **Bypass permission prompts** — skips confirmation dialogs. Useful if you trust your agent (and live dangerously).
- **Tmux mode** — wraps agent sessions in tmux so they survive app restarts. Requires tmux.
- **Auto-rename branch** — lets Claude Code rename the branch to match the task.
- **Coding CLI** — switches the Agent tab between Claude Code and Codex.
- **Agent Teams** — experimental multi-agent coordination, currently available with Claude Code.

#### Quick actions

Quick actions run one-shot coding CLI tasks from the sidebar:

- **Commit** — stages and commits with an AI-generated message
- **Push** — pushes the current branch to origin
- **Create PR** — creates a pull request with AI-generated title and description
- **Close PR** — closes the PR

These run as background Claude Code or Codex commands, depending on the selected CLI. Enable **Quick action debug mode** in settings if you want to know how the sausage is made. Trust us, [Francesc](https://github.com/barnolacesc) spent more time than he can admit debugging weird behaviors in there.

## Your Workspace

Terminals, browsers, editors, and shortcuts — the tools inside each workstream.

### Terminals

Terminals are GPU-rendered via [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org). They're fast.

- **⌘T** — new terminal tab
- **⌘W** — close tab (or Ctrl+D to exit the shell)
- **⌘1** — Info, **⌘2** — Coding Agent, **⌘3-9** — switch between tabs
- **⌘Shift+[** / **⌘Shift+]** — cycle through tabs

You can drag files and text onto the terminal. Because sometimes the mouse is fine, actually.

**⌘Option+T** opens the workstream directory in your preferred external terminal app.

### The Browser

Every workstream can have browser tabs (⌘B). The browser is embedded — no window switching needed.

#### Port detection

When your run script starts a dev server, Dockyard detects the listening port automatically and navigates the browser to it. No configuration needed. The `dy-run` launcher monitors the process tree for TCP listeners.

#### Navigation

- **⌘L** — focus the address bar
- **⌘Option+B** — open current URL in your external browser
- **⌘Click** — opens links in your external browser

The browser shows a connection error page with a retry button if the server isn't ready yet. It'll auto-navigate once the port is detected.

### The Editor

Each workstream can have editor tabs (⌘O). The editor is Monaco — the same engine that powers VS Code.

## Configuration

How to automate the boring parts.

### Scripts & Lifecycle

Drop a `.dockyard.json` in your project root to automate the workstream lifecycle.

```json
{
  "setup": "npm install",
  "run": "PORT=$DY_PORT npm run dev",
  "teardown": "docker-compose down"
}
```

| Hook | When it runs |
|------|-------------|
| `setup` | Once, when a workstream is created. Install dependencies, run migrations, whatever. |
| `run` | On demand via the Environment tab. Wrapped in `dy-run` for port detection. |
| `teardown` | When a workstream is archived or purged. Stop containers, clean up. |

All fields are optional. Scripts run in the workstream directory using your login shell. Yes, even [fish](https://github.com/barnolacesc/dockyard/pull/324). Don't ask how long that took.

Dockyard also reads `.emdash.json`, `conductor.json`, and `.superset/config.json` if `.dockyard.json` doesn't exist. Because compatibility is polite. (Time for a [standard](https://xkcd.com/927/)?) When using a fallback config, Dockyard injects compatibility environment variables so scripts work without modification (e.g. `CONDUCTOR_PORT`, `EMDASH_PORT`, `SUPERSET_PORT_BASE`).

#### The Environment tab

Split-pane layout: **Setup** on the left, **Run** on the right.

- **⌘Shift+Return** — start/restart the run script

### Environment Variables

Every terminal, setup script, and run command in a workstream has these variables:

| Variable | What it is | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `DY_PROJECT` | Project name | `my-app` |
| `DY_WORKSTREAM` | Workstream name | `coral-tidal-reef` |
| `DY_PROJECT_DIR` | Main repository path | `/Users/you/my-app` |
| `DY_WORKTREE_DIR` | Worktree path | `~/.dockyard/worktrees/my-app/coral-tidal-reef` |
| `DY_PORT` | Deterministic port (40001-49999) | `42847` |
| `DY_DEFAULT_BRANCH` | Default branch (main, master, etc.) | `main` |

#### About DY_PORT

Each workstream gets a deterministic port based on a hash of the worktree path. Same workstream, same port, every time. No port conflicts between workstreams. Use it in your run script: `PORT=$DY_PORT npm run dev`. If your thing is running thousands of workstreams simultaneously, you might get a collision 🎲 but hopefully you run out of memory first.

#### .env symlink

When enabled (Settings > General), Dockyard symlinks `.env` and `.env.local` from your main repo into each worktree. So your secrets follow you without copy-pasting.

### Settings

Open with **⌘,** or click the gear icon.

#### General

- **Base directory** — default location for new projects
- **Branch prefix** — prefix for workstream branches (default: `ff`)
- **Symlink .env files** — auto-symlink `.env` and `.env.local` to worktrees
- **Theme** — System, Light, or Dark
- **Language** — System default, English, Catalan, German, Spanish, or Swedish
- **Confirm before quitting** — asks before closing with active workstreams
- **Launch at login** — starts Dockyard on boot

#### Coding Agent

- **Bypass permission prompts** — disables confirmation for agent actions
- **Agent Teams** — experimental multi-agent mode
- **Auto-rename branch** — agent automatically renames branch based on intent
- **Tmux mode** — session persistence via tmux

#### Apps

- **External Terminal** — which terminal app to open with ⌘Option+T
- **External Browser** — which browser for ⌘Option+B and ⌘Click

#### Advanced

- **Detailed logging** — logs script output for debugging
- **Quick action debug mode** — shows raw output from quick actions
- **Bleeding edge updates** — opt into pre-release builds
- **Clear project list** — nuclear option, removes all projects from sidebar

---

## Integrations

Connecting Dockyard to everything else.

### CLI

Install the `ff` command from Settings > Environment > Install CLI. Then:

```
ff /path/to/your/project
```

Opens the directory in Dockyard. That's all it does, and that's all it needs to do.

### GitHub

Requires the [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) with authentication (`gh auth login`).

- **Project view** — repo info, description, stars, forks, open issues, recent PRs
- **Workstream sidebar** — PR number, title, and status (open/merged/closed) per branch
- **Merged detection** — shows "Purge" badge when a branch's PR is merged

#### Quick actions

From the sidebar, run one-click operations: **Create PR** (AI-generated title and description), **Push** (to origin with `-u`), or **Close PR** (closes with a comment). Because if you're tired of typing "now commit, push, and open a PR" into your agent for the hundredth time, you're not alone.

### Updates

Dockyard shows a badge in the sidebar when a newer version is available. You can also check manually from **Dockyard > Check for Updates...**

**Homebrew users:**

```
brew upgrade dockyard
```

**DMG users:** updates are handled automatically via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org). Check manually from the menu: **Dockyard > Check for Updates...**

Enable **Bleeding edge updates** in Settings > Advanced for pre-release builds. For those who like to live on the edge and file bug reports.

## Enterprise Features 😉

### Full IDE

Nope. There's a built-in editor (⌘O) for quick looks and small edits — but we're not building an IDE. For serious editing sessions, you should be using the tools you already love: [Zed](https://zed.dev), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), whatever. Dockyard gives you a coding agent, a browser, a worktree, and just enough editor to not have to leave. Besides, who's writing code anymore?

### Merge Viewer

Also nope. Your git client already does this better than we ever would. We just make sure each workstream has a clean branch ready for review. You are keeping your PRs small and avoiding merge conflicts, right? ...Right?

---

## Troubleshooting

#### "Tools not found"

Dockyard detects tools from your login shell. If `claude`, `codex`, `gh`, `git`, or `tmux` aren't showing up:

- Make sure they're in your shell's PATH
- Fish 4.0 and Nix users: the app handles these environments, but if something's off, check Settings > Environment

#### Tmux sessions not persisting

- Verify tmux is installed and detected (Settings > Environment)
- Dockyard uses its own tmux socket (`-L dockyard`), so your personal tmux config won't interfere

#### Port not detected

- Make sure your run script uses `$DY_PORT` (or the port gets detected from the process tree)
- The `dy-run` launcher wraps the run script — it monitors child processes for listening TCP ports
- Check Settings > Advanced > Detailed logging for debug output

#### Something else broken?

- [Report a bug](https://github.com/barnolacesc/dockyard/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) — tell us what went wrong
- [Submit a fix prompt](https://github.com/barnolacesc/dockyard/issues/new?template=fix_prompt.yml) — write the prompt, we'll let the agent take a crack at it
- [Something else](https://github.com/barnolacesc/dockyard/issues/new) — ideas, questions, existential doubts
